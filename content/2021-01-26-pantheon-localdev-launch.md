## Pantheon's LocalDev is Officially Deprecated

On June 30, 2023, Pantheon discontinued support for its built-in LocalDev feature. We are making this change because in the years since we introduced LocalDev, a number of more fully-featured options have become available to developers, allowing offline development and code editing. Have no fear: we’re here to help you with the transition.


## Why Should I Use Instead?

Lando is available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. It allows developers to quickly spin up the services and tooling needed to work on development projects. Developed by the team at Tandem, Lando helps developers assign dependencies on a per-project basis with config tooling that can live in a project’s git repository. 

Lando has “recipes” - a feature consisting of combinations of commonly used services and tooling to enable specific use cases. There is one specifically designed for sites hosted on the Pantheon Platform. [Get Lando](https://lando.dev/download/)!

Pantheon also provides an [installation guide](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/local-development/lando-wordpress) for users to reference.
